We have built a pizza ordering app that provides a wide range of pizza choices and enables user to view the menu, add to cart, pay with stripe (with test api key) and also view the status of the orders.

We also have provided users with a contact form which sends a reply email to their entered email addresses.

Our app only allows authenticated users through login and registration pages

The menu page displays the categories of pizza flavors.

The user can add pizzas to their cart from the home page itself. Upon clicking on an item, a modal opens where the user can choose the size and extra ingredients of their pizza.
